44 added things to grammar, have a good testsuite, work on lexicon
45 tried parsed test suite with new version - evaluated against mapped trees

Monday: Replace 43,53 in testMedium, define 'sådan'-category
Tuesday: meet ramona, find out how often 'annat' is used as SP.
         add 'fler'. add 'hela' and other determiners, work on 'bara'.
Wednesday: 'även', 'bara', start on 'kommer att' -problems with gf-versions
Thursday: seminar, 'kommer att'
          not done: 'varandra', 'olika', 'antalet', look over 'katterna är
           gulast/flest', check 'git throw away commit'
Friday: fix mess from Thursday, restructure VP, write, plan next week (and rest of semester),
        mail elisabet, read cle, dispostition
 

put together a list of grammar I want to add and send to
        Elisbet. 
       

meeting with ramona:
we can't get lexin, search talbanken may be good (later). also noun-
guessing is needed. it could work for compounds, by trying to find the
basic form, just to enable parsing. need opponent!
