         add 'fler'. add 'hela', work on 'bara'.
Wednesday: 'sj채lv', '채ven', start on 'kommer att'
Thursday: 'kommer att', 'varandra', 'olika', 'antalet', look over 'katterna 채r
           gulast/flest'

        read cle, dispostition
 

put together a list of grammar I want to add and send to
        Elisbet. 
       

meeting with ramona:
we can't get lexin, search talbanken may be good (later). also noun-
guessing is needed. it could work for compounds, by trying to find the
basic form, just to enable parsing. need opponent!
