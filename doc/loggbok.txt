v 37
This week I have been working on the mapping of Talbanken trees.
I use the trees in Talbanken05 (flat version), and so far the mapping
seams to be unambiguous. On the other hand, I don't spend much time on
the constructions that aren't allowed in GF yet, I save that for later.
I have made a list of problems and things that should be added (probably)
to GF (MappingProblemList.txt)
However, the mapping takes much more time than I had expected, I still
have a lot to do, even though I'm only considering short sentences.
So I could probably spend all of next week on the mapping...

I will spend the rest of the week (day) to examine Extract and Maltparser,
cleaning my code and organizing my work.
