v 38 1/2
I've been working on the mapping, which just becomes harder and harder,
and tested it on the testsuite I was using before the summer, where
the sentences are relatively easy. Since the testsuit was in another
format than the one I'm using now, I have to put some time into
getting the same sentences in the new format.
The testsuite now consists of 118 sentences, and the translator fails
completely for 38 of those. The resulting trees are saved in mappingShort.txt.
This testsuite are not meant to be the testsuite for the whole project, so 
I will extract another one soon. For Maltparser, they used 10% as for testing,
so I could probably do the same.
I hope to improve the mapping during this week.
Some functions have also been added to my grammar, RelNP' (kvinnan som äter)
and another PassVP (äts).

v 37
This week I have been working on the mapping of Talbanken trees.
I use the trees in Talbanken05 (flat version), and so far the mapping
seams to be unambiguous. On the other hand, I don't spend much time on
the constructions that aren't allowed in GF yet, I save that for later.
I have made a list of problems and things that should be added (probably)
to GF (MappingProblemList.txt)
However, the mapping takes much more time than I had expected, I still
have a lot to do, even though I'm only considering short sentences.
So I could probably spend all of next week on the mapping...

I will spend the rest of the week (day) to examine Extract and Maltparser,
cleaning my code and organizing my work.
