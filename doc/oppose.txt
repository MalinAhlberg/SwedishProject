First of all, I think your thesis is very well-written and also
explains your work well, withou leaving any loose ends.

It seams as one of the biggest problems during the simulations
was concurrency problems; when two airplanes are reaching a one-way
taxiways, they might be kept in a deadlock, waiting for each other.
Did you use any concurrency strategies, like semaphores, to avoid this,
and if not, would it be useful to implement in the future, or do you
think that using other path-finding algorithms would prevent this behavoir?

My second question is about your research question number 5, found on
page 7, "How robust can a solving algorithm be, i.e. how well can it deal with
last moment unforeseeable changes?". Did you find any answer to this?

Finally, I have a question regarding research question number 6,
"What is the traffic limit for a specific airport, after which the
system crashes, i.e. is unable to recover to a normal operation?". 
For the simulation on Arlanda, you get many blockings of airplanes for
some runway usage patterns. Does this mean that the
traffic limit for Arlanda is reached, or closed to reached, for these
patterns?
