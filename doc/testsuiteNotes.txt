I have two testsuites for the mapping: one with short (3-10 words sentences),
where the words had been exchanges to known words of the same category.
I also had one with randomly picked sentences. the mapping restored 85% of the
nodes in the easy one, and 64% of the hard one. Since talbanken does not
give information about valency, the mapper needs to get this info from the
lexicon.

I now plan to create more testsuites for the other parts. I want:
a list of words paired with the sentence number, to test the lexicon.
one testsuite with random sentences (may be the mapping one)
one testsuite with sentences without *,),- etc
one testsuite with short sentences (may be the mapping one)
a way of easily extracting the bare sentences (without xml) from those
