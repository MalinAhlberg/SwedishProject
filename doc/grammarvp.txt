want to : 1 add tempus 'kommer att' (future)
          2 keep passive forms in VP
          3 keep particips in VP

How to separate from Scandinavian? Separate everything, just small parts?
 started with tempus, but couldn't separate the tense enough from
 the other languages (variants does not work for). there is equivalent
 'kommer til Ã¥' in norwegian, but not in danish (?). want to separate
 them anyway, since I want more things in the Swedish. the problem is
 that everythin, more or less, is effected by the verb phrase.
 could simply copy-paste everything and not care about nor/dan, but 
 seems like a waste.

How to handle particips?
 lars said that all perfect particips will be treated as adjectives
 in next saldo. but they will still be forms of the verb in gf, and
 if we manage to get valance-information for verbs, we can use this
 for the particips also. but might not want to duplicate everything
 to the VP also?
