The mapping can deal with sentences in main, inverted and
subordinate order. It can map questions, some relative clauses
etc. However it still has problems with the complicated verbs (=all verbs)
Complications occur when the complement are split in unnice ways:
'vad skulle du vilja äta idag'
There are no rules for V3 and other cases may be missing too.
The list of label-rules makes the mapping pretty robust, but
on the other hand the most interesting information (the top nodes)
will still be missing.
Talbanken trees are flatter, which makes the translation harder.
Might be ambiguities when dealing with more complicated verb sentences.
If there are verbs that can be used with or without particles,
the mapper will be confused. This should therefore not be allowed,
a smaller but covering lexicon should be used, although this
will lead to complications when simplifying the sentences. Much 
manual work may be required to get it right.
Conjuction is a problem, especially at satsnivå, but is not important
enough at this stage, since we will be focusing on easier sentences anyway.
To many subordinate clauses will fail, one might work. Does not have the same 
analysis.
Idioms are not dealt with. 
'kallas' is not ok.
'kommer att' is not ok.
DB is not ok.
There are many XP/NAC tags, unclear how to handle this. Used often since
the analysise is different from GF. Example: 'eller skyddsomudet på arbetsplatsen'.
Parsable in GF, but Talbanken wants to know if it is subject or object and is
confused >> NAC.
The high number of pronouns in Talbanken has been confusing, but is probably
solved (who can know for sure)
Have problems with 'finnas' (Exist). Is probably translated to ImpersCl.
'deras värde som','han är som'. Apposition in Talbanken. 


Problems:
av -which one? same problem when parsing how ever.
kommer att needs to be added!!
