sådana:
started by reading in SAG, they only group sådana with likadan. extracted all pronouns from saldo which
are used as both determiners and SP (subjective predicative complement). Got a list of six:
 sådana, fler,något, mycket,ingen,annan,(likadan (not in talbanken, but by saldo))
ingen and någon is already in gf, by something, some_Pl osv.
the rest can be split into two groups: the ones who take their number from the subject and the ones who don't
 ex: 'en sådan bil, sådana bilar' -- 'fler bilar' . not 'fler bil'
in the group of sådana we now have likadana and annat. annat is maybe not really good. det är annat?
since någon/inget is already added, we are left with likadan and sådan (just like sag said...)
maybe need another category for fler, mer. they can also be compared : 'flest bilar'

decided to split into two categories, seems to work ok. likadan is not treated as a pronoun..
