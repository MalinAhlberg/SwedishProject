added a field in VP to keep passive form, and a way to choose between them.
is good, can say den ges till henne. But problem the other way around:
 hon ges den till. (hon= subject). 
Stupid! Just have PassV2 and V3, 

BigTest> p "den ges till henne"
PhrUtt NoPConj (UttS (UseCl (TTAnt TPres ASimul) PPos (PredVP (DetNP_utr (DetQuant DefArt NumSg)) (ComplSlash (PassV3 give_V3) (UsePron she_Pron))))) NoVoc
BigTest> p "till henne ges den"
PhrUtt NoPConj (UseFoc (TTAnt TPres ASimul) PPos (FocObj (UsePron she_Pron) (SlashVP (DetNP_utr (DetQuant DefArt NumSg)) (PassV3 give_V3)))) NoVoc

can remove Pass from VP? (done)

 added field a0 to keep track of 'bara', seems to work.


There are two ways of forming passive verb phrases in Swedish: the 
periphrastic passive, formed by using a modale auxiliary verb 
\enumsentence{Bilden blev tagen av  av rymdsonden Galileo}
\enumsentence{The picture was taken by spacecraft Galileo}.
or by adding an \emph{s} to
the verb:
\enumsentence{Bilden togs av rymdsonden Galileo}
\enumsentence{The picture took+s by spacecraft Galileo}.
This second variant, the s-passive, is commonly used in Swedish, some research
suggest that it is used in more than 80\% of the times \ref{laanemets}.
The other scandinavian languages prefers the periphrastic passive, especially in spoken langauge.
\enumsentence{Bildet ble tatt av romsonden}
The resource grammar for Scandinavian therefore allowed/expressed constructions using auxiliary verb.
\verb|PassV2 : V2 -> VP | \\
\verb|äta -> blev äten| \\
This rules allows two-place verbs to be used in passive by using \emph{bli} (\emph{become}), and thereby
turned into comlpete verb phrases; they no longer need an object.
The s-passive has now been added as the standard case for the Swedish GF
grammar. The auxiliary one is still allowed, but as an alternative rather than
the default.
The grammar also allows using three-place verbs, as \emph{give} \verb|V3| to form passives: \\
\enumsentence{Betyget 3 ges till många elever}
\label{ex:passV3}
by letting the first object be `removed' and expressed in the subject. 
Sentences where the second object is put first in the sentence, like \enumsentence{Till många elever ges betyget 3},
is a variant of example \ref{ex:passV3}, \emph{många elever} is still the object but put in focus. The grammar
parse this by applying \verb|FocObj|.
