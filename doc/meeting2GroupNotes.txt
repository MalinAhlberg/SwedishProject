report: aarne: before new years
        ramoona: before christmas

make webpage with grammar!
parse trees: fix for my presentation, peter had new solution
      that comes from abstract trees? latex and tiger xml also works.
  generalized phrase structures have better parse trees?

grammar:
-Foc should be called Top. intersting when they can be used in subordinate clauses.
should maybe not be Foc.
-Passive, all VPSlashes, and how are they used with reflexives
check Urdu for smarter VPs.
-solve CN/NP problem with dep.types? exchange many, few to Num.
