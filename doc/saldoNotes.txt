I have imported saldo. this resulted in more than 100 000 entries.
problems:
valency (for verbs mainly, but also others). no information about this
 in saldo, nor in talbanken. Lexin have some nice info, if we could use that.
 or extract info from korp/talbanken/leave it to the chunkparser?
more gf forms than saldo forms sometimes, saldo only contains the ones that are
 actually used, gf generates all. not really a problem for parsing, anyway. 
words that misses forms in saldo fails because needs them for smart paradigm,
 can use verbguesser for this 
translation of lemma-namnes, kaeltisk/kältisk both occur in saldo,
   translation a with apostroph irreversible
loses information about comparative adverbs. could add this to gf.
finds reflexive verbs and verbs with particles (hope this is correct, check?)

have added extra paradigm for adjectives because manymany adjectives are
irregular but does not have comparative forms, so seems stupid to make
them up in the lexicon. added more than 4000 adjectives with this.
could not be called mkA, since it takes three forms and there is already a 
paradigm for three form (tung,tyngre,tyngst) so it is added as compoundA, 
which is now overloaded. existed: compoundA : A -> A
                         added  : compoundA : (x,y,z:Str) -> A

have tested against talbanken and there are 3058 (excluding proper names
and numerals) words missing (may be
same entries in different forms). More than 2000 of those are nouns,
most of them compounds. This suggests some work on a nounguesser, but
mostly it suggests that compounding is interesting\important. 303 are verbs
, and then there are some of all other word classes. there is also a list of
words that exists in saldo, but as another category than in talbanken. These
may be either ok ones, like prounouns in talbanken but Ns in gf, or 
not ok ones, like 'för' which is a ++KS (some conjuction) in talbanken but
in gf it exist only in other forms such as a form of the verb 'föra'.
This list is worth a closer look.

skips personal names, pronouns (but there are many words here that would
be nice to add), prepositions (those should be added too!), verbs with many
arguments (idioms). there are lists of all of those. I would like to
make a idiom-dictionary.
