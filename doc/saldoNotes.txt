my old notes disappeared!!! >:(((

I have imported saldo. this resulted in more than 100 000 entries.
problems:
valency (for verbs mainly, but also others). no information about this
in saldo, nor in talbanken.
more gf forms than saldo forms sometimes
words that misses forms in saldo fails because needs them for smart paradigm
translation of namnes, kaeltiska/kältiska, a with apostroph still irreversible
loses information about comparative adverbs
features:
finds reflexive verbs and verbs with particles (hope this is correct, check?)

have added extra paradigm for adjectives because manymany adjectives are
irregular but does not have comparative forms, so seems stupid to make
them up in the lexicon. added more than 4000 adjectives with this.

have tested against talbanken and there are 3058 (excluding proper names
and numerals) words missing (may be
same entries in different forms). More than 2000 of those are nouns,
most of them compounds. This suggests some work on a nounguesser, but
mostly it suggests that compounding is interesting. 303 are verbs, and then
there are some of all other word classes. there is also a list of words that
exists in saldo, but as another category than in talbanken. These may be
words like either ok ones, like prounouns in talbanken but Ns in gf, or 
not ok ones, like 'för' which is a ++KS (some conjuction) in talbanken but
could be a form of the verb 'föra'. This list is worth a closer look.

skips personal names, pronouns (but there are many words here that would
be nice to add), prepositions (those should be added too!), verbs with many
arguments (idioms). there are lists of all of those. I would like to
make a idiom-dictionary.
