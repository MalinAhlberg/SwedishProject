have changed krasses code, got more than 98000 entries.
prints lists of all failing words.
uses saldom.xml, converts to haskell and all forms given should be the same
as the gf given ones.
script for splitting saldo in reasonable parts and treat
them separately to save memory (needed even on 8GB).
namnkonvertering - ambiguost failar allt, sa maste ha olika + k√§ltiska, kaeltiska
 see inari-mail about opinions. could be reversible with some changes (a apastrof,
 hyphens)
refl
particles (difference prepositions)
valency - big problem
problems with words that do not have all forms (adjectives without
  comparative). Had to add new paradigm for those.

excluded tags : vbm (most), abm, nnm, nna, pronouns (many, would
  require different tagging in gf),personal names.
adverbs that can be compared needs special treatment in gf.  
list that of idioms (nnm, abm) should be extracted.
reason for failing (all categories): all forms not in saldo (passive verbs,
  mera-adjectives, nouns in plural/determined form).
