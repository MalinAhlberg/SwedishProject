my old notes disappeared!!! >:(((

I have imported saldo. this resulted in more than 100 000 entries.
problems:
valency (for verbs mainly, but also others). no information about this
in saldo, nor in talbanken.
more gf forms than saldo forms sometimes
words that misses forms in saldo fails because needs them for smart paradigm
translation of namnes, kaeltiska/k√§ltiska, a with apostroph still irreversible
loses information about comparative adverbs
features:
finds reflexive verbs and verbs with particles (hope this is correct, check?)

have added extra paradigm for adjectives because manymany adjectives are
irregular but does not have comparative forms, so seems stupid to make
them up in the lexicon. added more than 4000 adjectives with this.

have tested against talbanken and there are 3058 words missing (may be
same entries in different forms). More than 2000 of those are nouns,
most of them compounds. This suggests some work on a nounguesser, but
mostly it suggests that compounding is interesting.

skips personal nouns, pronouns (but there are many words here that would
be nice to add), prepositions (those should be added too!), verbs with many
arguments (idioms). there are lists of all of those. I would like to
make a idiom-dictionary.
